fn reverse_string(s: &str) -> String {
    s.chars().rev().collect::<String>()
}

fn main() {
    let original = "hello";
    let reversed = reverse_string(original);
    println!("Original: {}", original);
    println!("Reversed: {}", reversed);
}
In this code:

The reverse_string function takes a reference to a string s.
It calls the chars method on the string to iterate over its characters.
Then, it calls rev to reverse the order of the characters.
Finally, it collects the characters into a String using collect.
In the main function, an example string "hello" is passed to reverse_string, and the result is printed to the console.
